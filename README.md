## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

The script operates in three main stages:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Forceful Browser Closure

Ensures no browser process is locking files before deletion.

```
Get-Process -Name firefox, chrome, msedge -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Firefox Extreme Cleanup

Locates all profile folders under:

```
$env:APPDATA\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles
```

Deletes all profile folders (including cache, history, and bookmarks)

Removes the profiles.ini file to force Firefox to create a new profile on next startup, preventing the ‚ÄúProfile Missing‚Äù error

3Ô∏è‚É£ Chrome and Edge Extreme Cleanup

For Chromium-based browsers, all user data is stored under User Data folders.
The script deletes the entire contents of these directories:

```
$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data
$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Edge\User Data
```

This includes:

- Passwords
- Bookmarks
- Extensions
- Cookies
- Preferences
- Cache

## üß© Expected Result

After running the script, all browsers will start as if newly installed, with no previous user data or configurations remaining.
